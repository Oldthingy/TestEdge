experiment in 20 page site

In 2009 I designed a Flash site for a client which has a panel similar to a tablet as its main page.
Each link in the file loads a new swf file or page and unloads it when appropriate. This is the Flash site:
http://www.theshaa.com

The site works seamlessly without undue delay in page loading.

Due to Mr Apple not liking to have Flash on iPad os the site cannot be viewed on these devices.
Thanks Apple. I love you.

My client now requests I produce a similar site in HTML so it can be viewed cross platform and in
more browsers. So I am trying to create the same effect in Adobe Edge Animate.

I should have retired years ago as I am not a geek, git or nerd which means I do very little code 
and need a graphic interface to create my ideas on.

I am struggling to get the same effect to load as quickly as Flash . . .

Huh Huh Urgh . . .
